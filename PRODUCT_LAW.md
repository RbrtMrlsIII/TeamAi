# PRODUCT LAW — TeamAi Canonical Front Door

`PRODUCT_LAW.md` is the product authority and MUST NOT be overridden by implementation, UI, deployment, provider, or tool conventions. The synchronized project package contains the complete Product Law text during this reconciliation window; this repository file is the engineering-visible authority front door for agent recovery.

## Current execution authority
The current sequence is:

`TEAM-EXPERIENCE-028 → PHASE 0 CLEAN BASELINE → TEAM-BACKEND-001 → TEAM-EXPERIENCE-029`

## Core authority invariants
- Human user authority remains above AI authority.
- Firebase Auth owns identity and Firebase UID ownership.
- Firestore `default` owns TeamAi durable domain/application state.
- Supabase Edge Functions own trusted server execution and PayPal webhook receipt.
- PayPal is the external payment-event authority.
- GitHub is the engineering/source authority.
- Vercel is optional future browser/deployment infrastructure, not current TeamAi backend authority.
- Supabase Postgres is platform infrastructure only and is not the TeamAi domain/application database.
- Retired PostgreSQL implementation is historical-only and must not remain an active/recoverable TeamAi backend path.
- Web AI and Development AI are separate operational domains.
- Universal ToolKit is upstream-only: validated/generalized TeamAi lessons may flow upstream; ToolKit does not become TeamAi authority.

## LAW 101 — IMPLEMENTATION TRACEABILITY IS A HARD COMPLETION GATE
Every implementation claim MUST be traceable from its governing Product Law and Masterplan execution item through the applicable contract/skill, actual implementation, verification evidence, and completion/endorsement record. Planning text, documentation presence, deployment presence, green unit tests, or endorsement alone MUST NOT be treated as implementation completion. A missing traceability link blocks the affected completion claim until an explicit, evidence-backed exception is recorded by the authorized human.

## Phase 0 disposition
Phase 0 is the clean development-entry gate. It verifies the active repository baseline, retired-backend removal from supported paths, service authority boundaries, team/toolkit boundaries, and synchronization of the current execution gate before TEAM-BACKEND-001 implementation.

See `docs/PHASE_0_CLEAN_BASELINE_2026-09-03.md` and `MASTERPLAN.md` for the current executable checklist.

## Canonical note
The complete Product Law remains in the synchronized project package and is not intentionally duplicated here during this reconciliation window. This front door MUST remain synchronized with any active authority changes.
