# MASTERPLAN — TeamAi Execution Authority Pointer

`PRODUCT_LAW.md` is the product authority. The full chronological Masterplan is maintained in the synchronized project package while this repository surface carries the active gates needed for agent recovery and execution.

## Current chronological gate
`TEAM-EXPERIENCE-028 → PHASE 0 CLEAN BASELINE → TEAM-BACKEND-001 → TEAM-EXPERIENCE-029`

## TEAM-BACKEND-001 — Backend Foundation

**Status:** IN IMPLEMENTATION.

### Chronological execution checklist
1. [x] Architecture/authority reconciliation encoded in executable service assertions.
2. [x] Firebase UID ownership hierarchy encoded in Firestore path contracts.
3. [x] Deterministic Web AI effective-skill resolution encoded; skills do not grant authorization.
4. [x] Durable task lifecycle and event/idempotency contract encoded.
5. [x] Firestore source configuration baseline wired: `firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`.
6. [x] Canonical Product Law, AI assistant recovery guide, Masterplan and backend evidence updated together.
7. [ ] Local Firebase emulator/rules execution verified.
8. [x] Authorized Firebase project identity, live `(default)` Firestore database, Email/Password and Google Auth providers, and Firestore Rules deployment verified.
9. [x] Workplace → Project → Team/Solo → Seat persistence source slice implemented and live authenticated creation, independent Firestore verification, and repeat-call idempotency are evidenced.
10. [x] Trusted Supabase Edge runtime persistence slice implemented and deployed with canonical Firebase project-identity enforcement; live authenticated execution, independent Firestore verification, and idempotency are evidenced.
11. [~] Gate 5B: server-owned PayPal ↔ TeamAi ↔ Firebase UID correlation contract implemented; executable project-wide validation pending.
12. [ ] Gate 5C: verified PayPal webhook authenticity, idempotency, replay protection, durable commerce event and entitlement projection implemented and evidenced.
13. [ ] Provider/runtime invocation connected only after authorization/task contracts.
14. [ ] Security, contract, integration, failure, timeout, cancellation and recovery verification complete.
15. [ ] Traceability audit reconciled from Product Law → plan → contract/skill → implementation → evidence → endorsement.
16. [ ] TEAM-BACKEND-001 completion endorsement recorded.
17. [ ] Only after all `BLOCKS_029` gates are evidenced: release hold on TEAM-EXPERIENCE-029.

### Gate 5B boundary
The server-owned commerce contract establishes a pending intent from the trusted Firebase UID and correlation ID. A later verified PayPal event binds its provider event ID to that existing intent and derives the stable idempotency key. The browser is never the source of payment ownership truth.

Evidence: `docs/CHECKPOINT_TEAM-BACKEND-001_GATE5B_2026-09-03.md`.

**Important:** Gate 5B is not live PayPal processing. No webhook authenticity, replay, entitlement, or payment-success claim is inferred from the contract alone.

### Current evidence boundary
Firebase persistence is independently evidenced. The PayPal webhook Edge Function remains a verification bootstrap boundary: it validates PayPal signature information when configured but intentionally defers TeamAi business-side processing until the canonical correlation and durable commerce model are in place. PayPal's current webhook guidance requires verification before processing and supports timestamp/replay protections. citeturn454723search1turn454723search2

### Hard completion rule
An implementation claim is complete only when its governing Product Law and Masterplan item trace through the applicable contract/skill, actual implementation, verification evidence, and completion/endorsement record. Planning text, documentation presence, deployment presence, green unit tests, or endorsement alone do not establish implementation completion.

## Target-project handover rule
Every completed gate must surrender a target-project handover packet/ZIP in the same execution. The handover belongs to TeamAi; Universal ToolKit only provides reusable upstream process knowledge and does not own TeamAi project state.
