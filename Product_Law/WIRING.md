# Product Law Wiring

**Role:** navigation and field-ownership map for `Product_Law/`. This file does not create a second Product Law.

## Canonical Product Law root

`Product_Law/PRODUCT_LAW.md` is the single Product Law document. It contains connected product meaning, protected invariants, service boundaries, development fields, responsibility model, workspace rules, skills boundary, authorization boundary, execution model, and product-wide constraints.

## Development fields

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Product & Governance | Product meaning, protected invariants, authority boundaries, governance contracts |
| Backend & Runtime | Identity, durable state, trusted execution, scheduler boundaries, provider/runtime integration |
| Frontend & Experience | Presentation, interaction, accessibility, responsive behavior, semantic machine rendering |
| Application Integration & Contracts | Typed seams, adapters, read models, payload/status/error contracts |
| Verification & CI/Browser | Tests, validators, browser evidence, CI gates, promotion evidence |
| Documentation, Knowledge & Session | Session state, validated learning, routing, continuity and handover |
| Recovery, History & Reconciliation | Archives, historical provenance, restoration, migration safety |
| Delivery & Operations | Deployment configuration and operational delivery surfaces |

## Canonical field companions

| Companion | Ownership | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `Product_Law/FRONTEND_EXPERIENCE.md` | Frontend & Experience | Subordinate field contract; may elaborate Product Law but cannot override it. |
| `Product_Law/CONNECTED_PLATFORM.md` | Backend & Runtime / Delivery & Operations | Connected-platform roles, evidence boundaries, and non-authority boundaries; subordinate to Product Law. |
| `Product_Law/WIRING.md` | Product & Governance | Routes fields and companions only; cannot create new authority. |

## Authority boundaries

Product Law owns meaning. Policy owns ORUCAVEAM. Masterplan owns ordered checklist execution. `Masterplan/NEXT_SLICES.md` owns one current slice. Skills own reusable procedures. Issues own bounded workstream context. PRs own implementation/review boundaries. Verification proves claims. `AI_ASSISTANT_READ_ME.md` owns current session state, handover, endorsement decisions, and validation-change records. `PRODUCT-KNOWLEDGE.md` owns durable validated concepts. `docs/archive/` and `handover/` are historical storage only.

## No parallel authority

Do not create another Product Law, current-state ledger, Masterplan, live HandOver manual, Endorsement file, Skill namespace, governance constitution, machine-law document, or `OBSOLETE_FILES.md` registry.
